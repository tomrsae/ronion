# ðŸ§… ROnion
Library for using the onion protocol to securely and anonymously connect to servers through onion relay nodes.

## Functionality
- Library consists of 5 main parts: 
  1. Consumer
  2. Relay
  3. Protocol
  4. Cryptography
- The Consumer's main purpose is to be the client's endpoint for communication with an Index and multiple Relays
- The Index's main purpos is to manage usable Relay nodes' connection to the network. It can recieve connections from both Consumer and Relay nodes, where Consumer should recieve a list of Relays the consumer can use, while the Relay nodes dotn need any responses (might change in future implementation). When a new Relay connects to Index, it is added to the Index's Relay list.
- The Relay's main purpos is to recieve payloads from an endpoint and relay that payload to another endpoint. Said endpoint can be either a Consumer, another Relay or the final unspecified endpoint indicated by the payload (e.g a webresource). 
- Onion-Protocol's main purpos is to act as this network's header and payload holder, officially known as 'Onion'. The onion indicates what Consumer, Index and Relay should do with the payload the onion holds. 
- Cryptography's main purpos is to provide ed_25519 + AES encryption of onions between Consumer, Index and Relay.
## Future work
- Refactor relay node code to make it more maintainable and readable.
- Write more formal documentation
- 
### Missing features
- Connecting a relay to an endpoint
- 
### Potential weaknesses
- 

## Dependencies
- x25519-dalek = "1"
- ed25519-dalek = "1"
- rand_core = { version = "0.5.1", features = ["getrandom"] }
- aes = "0.8.1"
- async-std = { version = "1.10.0", features = ["attributes"] }

## Installation
ROnion is first and foremost a library, therefore there is no way to install it.

However, to use the library, ...

Examples programs for Consumer, Relay and Index may be found in the "cmd" folder.

## Usage
The ROnion library can be used to create your own versions of consumer, relays and index nodes.

It provides the necessary data structures to create onion networks and securely and anonymously sending data over it.

## Running tests
- To run this project's tests you need to use Rust's package manager 'cargo'. 
- ``git clone` and `cd` into the project, then run the tests using `cargo test`.

## Documentation
Formal, accessible documentation is currently lacking and a point for future work.

Documentation for the code can however be found in their corresponding source files.
